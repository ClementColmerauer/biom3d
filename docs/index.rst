Biom3d
===================================

Congrats! You've just found Biom3d, a super easy-to-use tool for volumetric image segmentation.

This tool is addressed to three different profiles:

- Non-programmer, who could be interested to use the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Programmer-user, who could be happy with some minimal customization, such as adapting Biom3d to a novel image format or choosing another training loss. 
- Programmer-developer, who are not scared of digging in some more advanced features of Biom3d, such as customizing the deep learning model or the metrics.
